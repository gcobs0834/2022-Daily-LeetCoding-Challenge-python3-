# [Python 3] üéüÔ∏è Linear Time Solution Well Explained üéüÔ∏è

## Brute Force (Not OPTIMAL)
Since we have to find two different day, we simply use two for loop to find the day we bought the stocks and the day we sell stock.
## Complexity Analysis
* Time: O(n^2) : Let *N* be the number of prices
* Space: O(1)

## Code
See [Solution.py]()


## Linear Time (OPTIMAL)
We store and update previousLow each time we traverse through the array, and calculate currentMax = max(currentMax, prices[i] - previousLow)
## Complexity Analysis
* Time: O(n) : Let *N* be the number of prices
* Space: O(1)

# [121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/)

You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

 

## Example 1:

Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.
## Example 2:

Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.
 

Constraints:

1 <= prices.length <= 105
0 <= prices[i] <= 104
