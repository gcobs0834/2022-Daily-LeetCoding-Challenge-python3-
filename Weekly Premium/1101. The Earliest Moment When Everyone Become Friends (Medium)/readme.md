# [Python 3] ðŸ”— Union-Find Solution

## Main Idea
Using Union-Find that helps us build the relationship between friends, and we use groups to count how many un connected components in the Union-Set => once groups == 1 means all friends connects each other.
## Complexity Analysis
* Time : O(M(logM)+M Î± (N)) Let *N* be the number of people and *M* be the number of logs.
> Note: We sort logs => O(M(log)M) + UnionFind takes O(M Î± (N)) thus => O(M(logM)+M Î± (N))
* Space: O(N) : UnionFind takes *N* spaces.

# [1101. The Earliest Moment When Everyone Become Friends](https://leetcode.com/problems/the-earliest-moment-when-everyone-become-friends/)

There are n people in a social group labeled from 0 to n - 1. You are given an array logs where logs[i] = [timestampi, xi, yi] indicates that xi and yi will be friends at the time timestampi.

Friendship is symmetric. That means if a is friends with b, then b is friends with a. Also, person a is acquainted with a person b if a is friends with b, or a is a friend of someone acquainted with b.

Return the earliest time for which every person became acquainted with every other person. If there is no such earliest time, return -1.

 

## Example 1:

Input: logs = [[20190101,0,1],[20190104,3,4],[20190107,2,3],[20190211,1,5],[20190224,2,4],[20190301,0,3],[20190312,1,2],[20190322,4,5]], n = 6
Output: 20190301
Explanation: 
The first event occurs at timestamp = 20190101 and after 0 and 1 become friends we have the following friendship groups [0,1], [2], [3], [4], [5].
The second event occurs at timestamp = 20190104 and after 3 and 4 become friends we have the following friendship groups [0,1], [2], [3,4], [5].
The third event occurs at timestamp = 20190107 and after 2 and 3 become friends we have the following friendship groups [0,1], [2,3,4], [5].
The fourth event occurs at timestamp = 20190211 and after 1 and 5 become friends we have the following friendship groups [0,1,5], [2,3,4].
The fifth event occurs at timestamp = 20190224 and as 2 and 4 are already friends anything happens.
The sixth event occurs at timestamp = 20190301 and after 0 and 3 become friends we have that all become friends.
## Example 2:

Input: logs = [[0,2,0],[1,0,1],[3,0,3],[4,1,2],[7,3,1]], n = 4
Output: 3
 

Constraints:

2 <= n <= 100
1 <= logs.length <= 104
logs[i].length == 3
0 <= timestampi <= 109
0 <= xi, yi <= n - 1
xi != yi
All the values timestampi are unique.
All the pairs (xi, yi) occur at most one time in the input.
